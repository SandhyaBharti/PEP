Window Object => The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is brower's object(not JavaScript's) &
is automatically created by the browser.
It is a "global" object with lots of properties and methods.
window.document
console.dir(window.document)

DOM => When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page
It is a tree like structure.
window -> document -> html
                        html -> head -> meta, meta, title, link
                        html -> body -> div -> img, h1, p, div 
                                & body -> script

DOM Manipulation => 
    1. selecting with id -> document.getElementById("myId")
    2. selecting with class -> document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
    3. selecting with tag -> document.getElementsByTag("p")
    4. querySelector -> document.querySelector("myId/myClass/tag") : returns first element 
                        document.querySelectorAll("myID/myClass/tag") : returns all elements (NodeList)
Properties: tagName -> returns tag for element nodes 
            innerText -> returns the text content of the element and all its children
            innerHTML -> returns the plain text or HTML contents in the element
            textContent -> returns textual content even for hidden elements 

Attributes: getAttribute(attr) // to get the sttribute value
            setAttribute(attr, value) // to set the attribute value the

Style: node.style 

Insert Elements: 1. node.append( el ) -> adds at the end of node(inside)
                2. node.preappend( el ) -> adds at the start of node (inside)
                3. node.beforeadd( el ) -> adds before the node (outside)
                4. node.after( el ) -> adds after the node(outside)

Delete Element : node.remove() -> removes the node 
// appendChild and removeChild

//Events: The cahnge in the state of an object is known as an Event. 
Events are fired to notify code of "intresting changes" that may affect code execution.
1. Mouse events (click, double click etc.)
2. Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
3. Form events (submit etc.)
4. Print event & many more 
                                
Event Object: It is a special object that has details about the event.
All event handlers have access to the Event Object's properties and methods.

Event Listeners: node.addEventListener(event, callback)
                 node.addEventListener(event, callback)
                the callback reference should be same to remove 

Classes and Objects: 
Prototype in JS -> A javaScript is an entity having state and behaviour(properties and method).
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
We can set prototype using __proto__ 

* if object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.

Classes in JS => Class is a program-code template for creating objects.
Those objects will have some state (variables) & some behaviour (functions) inside it.
class MyClass{
    constructor(){...}
    myMethod(){...}
}
let myObj = new MyClass();

Constructor in JS:Constructor method is: 
a. automatically invoked by new -> constructor(){...}
b. initializes object -> myMethod(){...}

Inheritance in JS: inheritance is passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class.
class Parent {}
class Child extends Parent {}
*If Child & Parent have same method, child's method will be used.[Method Overriding]

Super Keyword: The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.
super(args)  // calls Parent's constructor
super.parentMethod(args)

Error Handling: 
try-catch
try{
    ...normal code
} catch (Err) {// err is error object
...handling error
}
